# Password Protection for static pages

This simple HTML document helps you protecting static pages or whole websites with no server configuration required: you can host a static password protected site on your Dropbox, Amazon S3 or any generic hosting service.

This project is a byproduct of my [Tumbless blogging platform] (https://github.com/matteobrusa/Tumbless) project.

How does it work?
0. Upload this HTML document and the background image to your static hosting service.
0. Load it up in your browser
0. Enter the password of your choice; it will show "wrong password"
0. Copy the section of the URL after the # 
0. Create a folder with that name next to the index.html 
0. Put the web pages that you want to protect inside the folder
